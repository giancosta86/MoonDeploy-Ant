# MoonDeploy - Ant

*MoonDeploy - Ant tasks*


## Introduction

**MoonDeploy - Ant** provides a set of reusable Ant tasks that can integrate [MoonDeploy](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy) into a wide range of build systems in the Java ecosystem (Ant, Maven, Gradle, ...) for the automated creation of [application descriptors](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy/wiki/App-descriptor:-Version-3).


It is not recommended to directly employ the Ant tasks, primarily because of dependency issues: the easiest and therefore suggested solution is the [dedicated Gradle plugin](https://github.com/giancosta86/MoonDeploy-Gradle).

For further information - especially to create a plugin for your own Ant-based tool, please refer to the documentation (and, perhaps, the source code) of the Gradle plugin.


## Download

The binary JAR is available at [the project page](https://bintray.com/giancosta86/Hephaestus/Moondeploy-Ant) on the Hephaestus Maven repository.

Please, remember that it depends on third-party JARs, available in JCenter or Maven Central.
